Domain Hosting Health Checker (Java GUI)

Overview
Domain Hosting Health Checker is a Java Swing-based GUI application that simulates monitoring the health of multiple domains.  
It allows users to view, search, update, and analyze domain hosting information such as DNS and SSL status.  

This project was built in NetBeans IDE as part of learning and applying Java programming concepts, object-oriented design, and GUI development.
